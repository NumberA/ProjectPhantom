# ProjectPhantom
Project Phantom is a Unity3D game that takes place during the Pieta arc of Claymore where you play as the No. 6, Phantom Miria.

The goal is to create a small or medium-sized game that looks and feels like Claymore and includes action-packed battles between the warriors and the awakened beings!
